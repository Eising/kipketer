# kipketer
A bandwidth testing platform with a strong templating engine

Kipketer was originally developed for Nianet A/S with the purpose of facilitating line testing on a larger scale.
It is now released under the MIT license excluding certain assets, but in an entirely functional state.

It facilitates the configuration of a loop on a remote CPE, and using this loop initiates and reports on throughput and latency tests.
