# Speedtest

This is the rewrite of the speedtest system, designed for Nianet RFS tests

Notice that this version has been modified and crudely removed *some* reference to Nianet files, and may therefore seem incomplete.
Documentation is also severely lacking and will be updated in the future.

# Requirements

Requires ruby version 1.9.3 or newer, rubygems and bundler. Run bundle install
after every update.

Runs on Puma and can be proxied by Nginx or run standalone.

Remote server must be owampd and thrulay-ng
